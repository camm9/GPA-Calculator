# GPA-Calculator
This program calculates the GPA of students from a textfile bearing the student's student number.

This program is an answer to a mock midterm for CSIS 2275 which asks that the student create a Java program that can
select input files, read the input files, and assemble data from the files. In this case, this program will read
the file of the corresponding entered student number and calculate that student's GPA.
The input file must be in the form of CSV.
